# C_StateML - Dec 2020

In development using state labelled data on N.Methods Fig.2 dataset. 
The input dataset can be found on PhD/D_CommonDatasets

Initial implementation as RF classifier using cell state markers (and possibly also apical-basal markers)
The more general the better (markers present in virtually all of our panels).

TODO: Fine tune CV and metrics with CI Hackathon's strat as a template
